Fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering algorithm 

Implement the Fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering algorithm to cluster the data of the 26
lower-case characters provided in the file “Assignment 3 Dataset.zip”. The zip file contains 7
images for each lower-case character. Apply your algorithm to the data provided. You
should set the fuzziness index q to 1.25 and the number of clusters to 26. The algorithm
should stop when the average distance between the centers obtained for one iteration and
the previous iteration is less than 10-5. One important aspect of FCM that changes the results
significantly is the initialization
